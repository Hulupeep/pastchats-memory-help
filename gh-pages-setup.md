# GitHub Pages Setup

If Pages is not enabled yet:

1. Open repo Settings
2. Go to **Pages**
3. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
4. Branch: `main`, folder: `/ (root)`
5. Save

Site URL becomes:

`https://hulupeep.github.io/pastchats-memory-help/`

Because this repo already has `_config.yml` with `baseurl`, links should resolve correctly.
